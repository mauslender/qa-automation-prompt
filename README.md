# QA Automation Challenge (Ruby)

This project is a solution to the **QA Automation Challenge**. It monitors an API, logs request results into a local SQLite database, calculates uptime, and helps identify a bug in name validation.

## üì¶ Setup

### 1. Clone or unzip the project

If you downloaded the `.zip`:

```bash
unzip qa_automation_challenge_ruby.zip
cd qa_automation_challenge_ruby
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Ensure Ruby is installed, then:

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

## üöÄ Scripts

### `monitor_api.rb`
Sends 1 request/second to the API and logs:
- URL
- name sent
- response status
- response text
- timestamp

```bash
ruby monitor_api.rb
```

Let it run for **10+ minutes** to capture a meaningful dataset.

---

### `calculate_uptime.rb`
Reads `request_logs.db` and calculates the uptime based on percentage of requests with status `200`.

```bash
ruby calculate_uptime.rb
```

---

### `find_bug.rb`
Finds failed requests in the database and prints them to help detect the input bug related to name formatting.

```bash
ruby find_bug.rb
```

## ‚úÖ Deliverable

- Commit the `request_logs.db` file after running the monitor script
- Push the project to a **private GitHub repository**
- Share it with `@conanbatt`

## üí° Notes

- Ruby was used as a bonus.
- Database is persistent and all scripts are runnable independently.
